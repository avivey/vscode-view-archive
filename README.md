# archive-viewer: A VSCode Extension

See content of various archive files without exiting the IDE.

## Features

Right-click any file in the Explorer and select "View Archive".

### Alpha

This is an Alpha release.

This version uses your machine's `lesspipe`, `file` and `unzip` programs to identify and display files.

It's unlikely to work on Windows (and only tested on Linux).
